# Frontend Mentor - Todo app solution

This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

Yep here is my first project using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and I am happy with it. I have not covered a lot in [React](https://reactjs.org/), but I decided to implement what I had learned first then move on to learn new things.
